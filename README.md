# NerdNode

## Description
A CMS-style blog site where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well.

The motivation behind this project was to create a solution that addresses the need for developers to have a social media site to discuss various concepts with blogposts and comments. By building this project, I aimed to explore the MVC paradigm with JavaScript, Handlebars, and Sequelize. I also strove to enhance my skills, and contribute to development landscape by deploying a functioning application.
